# Peter's 816 Cuts

## Overview

This is the iOS component of Peter's 816 Barber Shop App. This app is a fork from the original, created with Spandan [Previous Peter's 816 Repository](https://github.com/spandanj/petersios). I forked the project to perform a major overhaul while learning iOS development concurrently and not destroy the existing project. The previous version allowed users to get a number and would occassionally send a notification when their haircut was up next. The initial version had refactored a significant portion of the code and added a reservation option, so users can request a specific appointment time.

## Other Components

There is a companion Android app and PHP back-end that I intend to upload in the near future.

## Current Status

Version 2.0 of the app is in production

## TODOs

- Minor cosmetic changes, phrasing on static text, re-introduce number currently being served, customer's number, and next available number
- Bug fixes: crash reports have decreased from prior version but still need to investigate the new ones
