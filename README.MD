# Peter's 816 Cuts

## Overview

This is the iOS component of Peter's 816 Barber Shop App. This app is a fork from the original, created with Spandan [Previous Peter's 816 Repository](https://github.com/spandanj/petersios). I forked the project to perform a major overhaul, while learning iOS development concurrently while not destroying the existing project for several months. The previous version allowed users to get a number and would occassionally send a notification when their haircut was up next. The current version has refactored a significant portion of the code and added a reservation option, so users can request a specific appointment time.
